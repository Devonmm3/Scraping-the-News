# Scraping-the-News

This app uses express, express-handlebars, mongoose, cheerio, axios packages, and scrapes the titles and articles from the Betches Sup website.  It is a website that I built, but the articles are not composed by me-they are taken straight from the Sup homepages so that the user can read them and comment on them.  

 * Headline - the title of the article

 * Summary - a short summary of the article

 * URL - the url to the original article
 are all available.
